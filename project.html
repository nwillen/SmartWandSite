            Smart Wand Description
        </h1>
        <p>
            TorchTech Industries developed a smart pelvic wand to address pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD),
             a medical condition in which pelvic floor muscles become weak or tight. The pelvic smart ward 
             is a mechanical wand that provide individuals with PFD the access to pelvic floor physical therapy 
             at home. Our goal is to develop an interactive mobile application for the purpose of improving 
             the accessibility of pelvic floor physical therapy. An interactive application would supply those 
             who suffer from PFD guidance through physical therapy exercises, contain an education feature that 
             provides exercise programs, instructions of wand placement, and a health forum to be edited by 
             clinicians and patients. The application will also allow users to create personal accounts that 
             store bio-based data from the wand after every therapy session providing a tracking system for 
             progress, live biofeedback and a mapping of the pelvic floor muscles.
